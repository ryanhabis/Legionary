WHAT IS ROBOCODE?
Robocode is a programming game where the goal is to code a robot battle tank to compete against other robots in a battle arena. So the name Robocode is short for "Robot code". The player is the programmer of the robot, who will have no direct influence on the game. Instead, the player must write the AI of the robot telling it how to behave and react to events occurring in the battle arena. Battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

Beside being a programming game, Robocode is used for learning how to program primarily in the Java language, but other languages like Kotlin and Scala is possible as well.

Schools and universities are using Robocode as part of teaching how to program, but also for studying artificial intelligence (AI). The concept of Robocode is easy to understand, and a fun way to learn how to program.
